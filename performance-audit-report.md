# Vue Components Performance Audit Report

## Summary
This report details performance issues found in Vue components within the nuxt/components directory. The analysis focused on common performance anti-patterns including missing v-for keys, excessive watchers, heavy operations in lifecycle hooks, and opportunities for optimization.

## Critical Performance Issues

### 1. **BuilderCarousel.vue**
- **Missing unique keys in v-for loops**: Lines 19, 30, 52 use array index as key, which can cause rendering issues when items change
- **No lazy loading for images**: Images don't use lazy loading attribute
- **Duplicate Swiper instances**: Two separate Swiper instances (normal and fullscreen) are always rendered

**Recommendations:**
- Use unique identifiers instead of array indices for v-for keys
- Add `loading="lazy"` to img tags
- Conditionally render fullscreen Swiper only when needed

### 2. **BuilderMasonryWall.vue**
- **Heavy operations in lifecycle hooks**: Complex layout calculations in onMounted (lines 361-425)
- **Multiple resize observers**: ResizeObserver, MutationObserver, and window resize listeners all active
- **Inefficient event handling**: Resize handler not properly debounced (debounce defined but not used correctly)
- **Console.log statements in production**: Multiple debug logs throughout the component
- **No image lazy loading**: Despite `loading="lazy"` attribute, no intersection observer for efficient loading

**Recommendations:**
- Move heavy calculations to computed properties or memoize results
- Consolidate observers and properly debounce resize handlers
- Remove console.log statements
- Implement proper lazy loading with intersection observer

### 3. **InteractiveHero.vue**
- **Missing component lazy loading**: BuilderCircularText and TextPressure imported synchronously
- **No performance optimization for animations**: Continuous animations running without consideration for reduced motion preferences

**Recommendations:**
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Consider using `v-memo` for static content

### 4. **Projects.vue**
- **Missing unique keys**: Line 30 uses array index for v-for key
- **DOM manipulation in lifecycle**: Direct DOM manipulation for cursor (lines 104-116)
- **Global event listeners without cleanup**: Mouse move listener added but not properly cleaned up
- **Inefficient hover handling**: Creating DOM elements for custom cursor on every component mount

**Recommendations:**
- Use project IDs or slugs as keys instead of indices
- Use CSS for cursor effects when possible
- Implement proper cleanup in onBeforeUnmount

### 5. **FlowingMenu.vue**
- **Complex scroll handling without throttle**: handleScroll function (lines 124-167) runs on every scroll event
- **Missing v-memo opportunities**: Menu items could benefit from memoization
- **Excessive DOM queries**: Multiple querySelector calls in scroll handler

**Recommendations:**
- Throttle scroll event handler
- Cache DOM references
- Use v-memo for menu items that don't change frequently

### 6. **MarqueeItem.vue**
- **Continuous CSS animations**: Marquee animation runs indefinitely (line 199)
- **No performance optimization**: Animation continues even when off-screen
- **Heavy GSAP operations**: Multiple GSAP timelines created on each hover

**Recommendations:**
- Pause animations when component is not visible
- Use CSS transforms with will-change for better performance
- Consider using requestAnimationFrame for smoother animations

### 7. **ContactForm.vue**
- **No form validation debouncing**: Real-time validation could benefit from debouncing
- **Missing loading states optimization**: Form could be lazy-loaded

**Recommendations:**
- Implement debounced validation
- Use dynamic import for form component if not immediately visible

### 8. **TextPressure.vue**
- **Heavy computations without memoization**: Font size calculations (lines 114-175) run frequently
- **Multiple intervals running**: Auto-animation creates multiple setInterval instances
- **Inefficient event listeners**: Multiple resize and orientation change listeners
- **Complex animations in mounted hook**: Heavy operations immediately on mount

**Recommendations:**
- Memoize font size calculations
- Consolidate intervals and timers
- Use single ResizeObserver instead of multiple event listeners
- Defer heavy animations until component is in viewport

### 9. **BuilderHeroExplosion.vue**
- **Heavy Three.js operations**: Complex WebGL rendering without performance considerations
- **No cleanup of animation frames**: Animation frames continue even when component unmounted
- **Dynamic imports not optimized**: Three.js and dat.GUI loaded but not tree-shaken
- **Continuous shader calculations**: Fragment shader runs complex calculations every frame

**Recommendations:**
- Implement LOD (Level of Detail) for mobile devices
- Properly cancel animation frames
- Use lighter alternatives for mobile
- Consider using OffscreenCanvas for better performance

## General Recommendations

### 1. **Implement Vue Performance Features**
```vue
<!-- Use v-memo for expensive list items -->
<div v-for="item in items" :key="item.id" v-memo="[item.id, item.updated]">
  <!-- content -->
</div>

<!-- Use v-once for static content -->
<div v-once>
  {{ staticContent }}
</div>
```

### 2. **Lazy Load Components**
```javascript
// Instead of
import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent.vue'

// Use
const HeavyComponent = defineAsyncComponent(() => 
  import('./HeavyComponent.vue')
)
```

### 3. **Debounce/Throttle Event Handlers**
```javascript
import { debounce, throttle } from 'lodash-es'

const handleResize = debounce(() => {
  // resize logic
}, 250)

const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
  // scroll logic
}, 100)
```

### 4. **Use Intersection Observer for Visibility**
```javascript
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      // Start animations/heavy operations
    } else {
      // Pause animations/cleanup
    }
  })
})
```

### 5. **Optimize Image Loading**
```vue
<img 
  :src="image.src" 
  :alt="image.alt"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  :width="image.width"
  :height="image.height"
/>
```

## Priority Actions

1. **High Priority**
   - Remove all console.log statements
   - Fix v-for keys to use unique identifiers
   - Implement proper debouncing for resize/scroll handlers
   - Add cleanup for all event listeners and observers

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Implement lazy loading for heavy components
   - Add v-memo for expensive computations
   - Optimize animation performance with intersection observers

3. **Low Priority**
   - Consider using CSS-only animations where possible
   - Implement progressive enhancement for complex effects
   - Add performance monitoring

## Conclusion

The components show several common performance anti-patterns that could impact user experience, especially on lower-end devices. Implementing these recommendations should significantly improve the application's performance and responsiveness.
